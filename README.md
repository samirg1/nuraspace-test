# Nuraspace Test
Code Challenge
Develop a web or mobile application that includes the following views and functionality:
1. Login
-  Implement a login screen where users can authenticate using a username
and password, or another authentication strategy you consider appropriate.
2. Home Page
- Provide a view where the user can select a city.
- After selecting a city, display the current weather for that location (using any
free weather API).
3. Live Messages
- Implement real-time popups to display messages.
- Use WebSockets (or an equivalent real-time solution) to deliver these
messages.
- Provide a mechanism to push messages into the system (e.g., an endpoint
that accepts a message and a target city).

Technical Guidelines
- The frontend must be developed using React.
- The backend should be implemented in Node.js (any framework of your choice).
- You may use any additional libraries or tools you find appropriate.
- Data storage can be kept in-memory for demo purposes.
- Use any free weather API to fetch weather data.
